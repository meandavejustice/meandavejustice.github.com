<h4 id="junior-developer-at-outthinkgroup-http-outthinkgroup-com-2011-2012">Junior Developer at <a href="http://outthinkgroup.com/">OutthinkGroup</a> 2011 - 2012</h4>
<p>In 2011 I started moonlighting from my day job as an auto mechanic to work with Outthink Group. We built
custom wordpress sites for self-published authors. This was my first paid gig working
with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>
<h4 id="front-end-engineer-at-tixie-https-tixie-com-2012-january-2013">Front-end Engineer at <a href="https://tixie.com/">Tixie</a> 2012 - January 2013</h4>
<p>Tixie was my first full time Development contract. Here I assisted in launching a full app rewrite.
I focused on building usable UIs and cleaning up technical debt. This was my first experience
working with Django/BackboneJS stack.</p>

<p>At Glider I helped rapidly build a front-end using Marionette BackboneJS as well as helping
to interview/on-board new hires. Glider was launched and presented at Techcrunch Disrupt NY 2013.</p>

<p>At Sprint.ly I helped take the existing front-end from under 1% test coverage to well over 50%, built
out a Selenium Testing Suite in python, implemented the reports view feature, worked on cleaning
up and adding more functionality to a plethora of existing components, dramatically sped
up the app by fixing rendering issues and adding more optimistic loading ui elements, converted
many outdated jQuery libraries into reusable modules, and helped to on-board new engineers.</p>

<p>After the merger between Sprint.ly and Quickleft I helped to get Quickleft engineers familiar
with the Sprint.ly codebase.</p>
