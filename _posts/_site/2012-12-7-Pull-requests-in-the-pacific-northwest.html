<p>The past couple months here in Portland have gone better than I could have imagined. After only two weeks I met <a href='https://twitter.com/joestump/'>Joe Stump</a> at Urban Airship . He gave me some very encouraging words, and some great advice on working in startups and the tech industry. Through him I met <a href='https://github.com/mattrobenolt/'>Matt Robenolt</a>, who he worked with on <a href='https://sprint.ly/'>sprint.ly</a>. Fortunatly for me, Matt saw potential in me and brought me on to help out at <a href='https://tixie.com'>tixie</a>. I&#8217;m amazed at how much I have been able to learn in such a short time. In Lynchburg I was building wordpress themes and geeking over CSS hacks until 2-3am nightly, and working full time as a mechanic. Now I&#8217;m contributing to open source projects and building my own web apps.</p>

<p>As much as I enjoyed working with my hands in shops, nothing compares to having a job where you literally learn something daily.</p>

<p>Really rad projects releasing fairly soon, promise.</p>
