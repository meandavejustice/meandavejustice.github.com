<p>After a 7 day drive from Lynchburg to Nashville, through Chicago, and Yellowstone. We finally arrived in Oregon!</p>

<p>After signing our lease and unloading the trailers,Â I headed to see <a href='http://www.reddons.com/'>Red Dons</a> play in the back of <a href='http://www.blackwaterpdx.com/'>Black Water Records</a>. Wandered around a bit after google maps took me to an empty construction site, but I found the venue just in time for Red Dons to go on. They played a super energetic show with the singer, bassist, and guitarist continuously running/falling into the crowd. Picked up a couple cool records from A.P.P.L.E. Dios Mio, and Infest. Everyone I talked to was super friendly, which was refreshing coming from the east coast. Basically 90% of all the people I have encountered since being here have been super helpful.</p>
