I've been thinking a lot lately about documentation. The node
community is somewhat known for having poor documentation and issues
with discoverablity. While the python community has fantastic tools
like [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), we are many times left
with a single readme.

### Keeping everything small

Our "One readme per package" practice fits in well with the small
module philosophy. But It can be painful digging around in
`node-modules` directories looking for that readme. Users generally
will just open up the repo and view the nicely formatted markdown in
the github ui. But what about offline development? This was a pain
point for us mentors at the most recent NodeSchool.io. Specifically
digging around for Async docs when students were continually being
booted off of the WiFi.

### man {package-name}

Being that our community loves to follow the
[unix philosophy](http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-node-js)
why not take advantage of tools developers are already familiar with?
Lets generate man pages for all of our node modules.

### man page generation

Generating man pages out of existing readme's is extremely straight
forward. There's already a module for that.

Go ahead and install [marked-man](https://github.com/kapouer/marked-man)

`npm install -g marked-man`

Now we just need to point marked-man to the markdown file we want to
generate our manpage from.

`marked-man README.md > doc/package-name.1`

Try it out by running

`man path/to/manpage`

You should get something like this.

Now all we need to do is let npm know about our manpage. We'll edit
our package.JSON.

If the module is installed globally with npm it will copy the manpages
from the path specified in the `man` property to
`{prefix}/share/man`.

It's as simple as that. If you'd like to dig in a little bit deeper on
this subject take a look at these resources.

* [Unix and Node: Manual Pages](http://dailyjs.com/2012/02/16/unix-node-community/)
* [Formatting Man Pages](http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/ReferenceManual/html/manpages.html)
* [Marked-man](https://github.com/kapouer/marked-man)
* [man npm docs](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html#man)

If your never without an internet connection or just hate man pages
you can always run the

[npm docs ...](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-docs.html) command:

`npm docs {package-name}`

Go forth and generate more accessible documentation!
