The past couple months here in Portland have gone better than I could have imagined. After only two weeks I met [Joe Stump](https://twitter.com/joestump/) at Urban Airship . He gave me some very encouraging words, and some great advice on working in startups and the tech industry. Through him I met [Matt Robenolt](https://github.com/mattrobenolt/), who he worked with on [sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/). Fortunatly for me, Matt saw potential in me and brought me on to help out at [tixie](https://tixie.com). I'm amazed at how much I have been able to learn in such a short time. In Lynchburg I was building wordpress themes and geeking over CSS hacks until 2-3am nightly, and working full time as a mechanic. Now I'm contributing to open source projects and building my own web apps.

As much as I enjoyed working with my hands in shops, nothing compares to having a job where you literally learn something daily.

Really rad projects releasing fairly soon, promise.
