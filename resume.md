## Summary

## Work Experience
#### Junior Developer at [OutthinkGroup](http://outthinkgroup.com/) 2011 - 2012
I started moonlighting from my day job as an auto mechanic, building custom wordpress sites for 
self-published authors with Outthink Group back in 2011. This was my first paid gig working
with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

#### Front-end Engineer at [Tixie](https://tixie.com/) 2012 - January 2013
Tixie was my first full time Development contract. Here I assisted in launching a full app rewrite.
I focused on building usable UIs and cleaning up technical debt. This was my first experience
working with Django/BackboneJS stack.

#### JavaScript Engineer at [glider](https://glider.com) January 2013 - May 2013
At Glider I helped rapidly build a front-end using Marionette BackboneJS. As well as helping
to interview/on-board new hires. Glider was launched and presented at Techcrunch Disrupt NY 2013.

#### JavaScript Engineer at [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/) January 2013 - January 2014
At Sprint.ly I helped take the existing front-end from under 1% test coverage to well over 50%. Built
out a Selenium Testing Suite in python. Implemented the reports view feature. Worked on cleaning
up and adding more functionality to a plethora of existing components. Dramatically sped
up the app by fixing rendering issues and adding more optimistic loading ui elements. Converted
many outdated jQuery libraries into reusable modules. Helped to on-board new engineers.

#### JavaScript Engineer at [QuickLeft](http://quickleft.com/) January 2014 - February 2014
After the merger between Sprint.ly and Quickleft I helped to get Quickleft engineers familiar
with the Sprint.ly codebase.

#### Contracting JavaScript Engineer on multiple projects February 2014 - present
