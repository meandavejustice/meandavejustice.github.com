## Work Experience

I started helping build custom wordpress themes for self-published authors with Outthink Group
back in 2011. This is where I got my start working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

#### Front-end Engineer at [Tixie](https://tixie.com/) 2012 - January 2013
Tixie was my first full time Development contract. Here I assisted in launching a full app rewrite.
I focused on building usable UIs and cleaning up technical debt. This was my first experience
working with django/backboneJS stack.

#### Javascript Engineer at [glider](https://glider.com) January 2013 - May 2013

to onboard new hires. Glider was launched and presented at Techcrunch Disrupt NY 2013.

#### Javascript Engineer at [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/) January 2013 - January 2014
At Sprint.ly I helped take the existing frontend from under 1% test coverage to over 55%. Built
out a Selenium Testing Suite in python. Implemented the reports view feature. Worked on cleaning
up and adding more functionality to a plethora of existing componenents. Dramatically sped
up the app by fixing rendering issues and adding more optimistic loading ui elements. Converted
many outdated jQuery libraries into reusable modules. Helped to onboard new engineers.
